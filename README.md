# meteor-file-jsSample-app
Port of [meteor-file-sample-app](https://github.com/vsivsi/meteor-file-sample-app) from COFFEE / JADE / SEMANTIC UI to JS / HTML / BOOTSTRAP

The [meteor-file-collection](https://github.com/vsivsi/meteor-file-collection) looks like a nice tidy package for doing simple
file uploads.  I am completely ignorant of Coffee Script, Jade and Semantic UI and unfortunately for me meteor-file-collection is
implemented with those technologies

As part of learning how to use meteor-file-collection
I decided to port the sample app over to JS, HTML and Bootstrap.  In the process I figured out how to use it.

I also figured that I would share the code so others in my predicament could take advantage of it.

Many thanks to [vsivsi](https://github.com/vsivsi)!

Enjoy!
